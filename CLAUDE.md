# Financial-Report Research Copilot — Project Context

## What This Project Is

An end-to-end, deployable, evaluation-driven system that answers analyst-style questions over SEC filings with **verifiable numbers and citations**, extended with **supply-chain dependency reasoning** as the vertical differentiator.

This is a lab/solo project (~3 months). It competes on **engineering systems**, not on retrieval benchmarks.

---

## Two-Stage Structure

### Stage 1 (Weeks 0–8) — RAG Financial Extraction & QA
A **standalone, complete project**. A deployed agentic copilot that answers Tier 1–2 financial questions with verifiable numbers and citations.

### Stage 2 (Weeks 8–12) — Graph Knowledge Layer
Additive differentiator. Supply-chain dependency graph built from EDGAR disclosures; enables Tier 3 cross-company exposure reasoning. **Do not start until Stage 1 ships.**

---

## Non-Negotiable Constraints

- **Numbers come from SQL + code, NEVER from LLM computation.** This is the cardinal rule.
- **Honest refusal over fabrication.** When evidence is absent, the system says "cannot determine."
- **No fine-tuning, no training.** LLM is API-only.
- **No PDF table extraction.** Use XBRL structured data to bypass it entirely.
- **No investment advice.** Always position as research aid.

---

## Out of Scope (do not implement)

- SOTA accuracy chasing on FinanceBench / FinDER
- LLM training or fine-tuning
- PDF table extraction
- Real-time news ingestion (8-K is optional)
- Automatic source-credibility scoring
- Expanding company cluster beyond initial group
- Multiple industries

---

## Company Cluster

**Apple supplier cluster** (recommended):
- Hub: Apple (AAPL)
- Suppliers: Skyworks, Qorvo, Cirrus Logic, Corning, Broadcom
- Constraint: US-listed only (10-K filers); avoid foreign filers (TSMC, Foxconn file 20-F)
- Time span: last 3–4 years

Customer-concentration edges are explicitly disclosed in 10-Ks (>~10% of revenue rule), making them extractable and verifiable.

## Architecture Summary

```
User → Frontend (Streamlit) → FastAPI → Agent Orchestration Layer
                                              ↓           ↓           ↓
                                      Postgres (XBRL)  pgvector   Edge table (Stage 2)
                                              ↑
                                      Data Pipeline (EDGAR ETL)
```

### Agent Tools
- `list_metrics(ticker)` → available metrics + year ranges for a company ✅ built
- `query_financials(ticker, metric, fiscal_year)` → Postgres XBRL numbers ✅ built
- `compute(expression, variables)` → sandboxed eval, never model-computed ✅ built
- `retrieve_text(query, ticker)` → hybrid BM25 + pgvector retrieval (RRF fusion) ✅ built
- `graph_query(...)` → graph traversal (Stage 2 only)

### Database Tables (all in PostgreSQL 18)
- `companies` — ticker, name, CIK
- `financial_facts` — XBRL numbers (ticker, label, value, period, accn) — 7,368 rows
- `filings` — 10-K metadata (accn, ticker, filed_date, doc_url) — 18 filings
- `text_chunks` — 10-K body text ~500 token chunks + `embedding vector(384)` — 969 rows, all embedded

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Language | Python 3.14 |
| Ingestion | EDGAR REST API + XBRL companyfacts/frames API |
| Storage | PostgreSQL 18 (Postgres.app on Mac) + pgvector 0.8.2 |
| Embeddings | `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` via sentence-transformers (local, 384 dims, no API key) |
| Retrieval | Hybrid BM25 + pgvector dense, fused with RRF (k=60) |
| LLM | Claude Sonnet 4.6 (agent), Claude Haiku 4.5 (LLM-judge in eval) |
| Agent | Hand-written loop, 4 tools, multi-step system prompt |
| Eval / Observability | Custom harness (numeric + citation + LLM-judge) + Langfuse (wired, not yet active) |
| Graph (Stage 2) | Postgres edge table + SQL (no Neo4j unless learning graph DBs) |
| API | FastAPI |
| Frontend | Streamlit (current), Next.js / React (later) |
| Deploy | Docker + Render/Railway/Fly |

## Question Tiers

| Tier | Type | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Tier 1 | Single-doc lookup | "Company A FY2023 revenue?" |
| Tier 2 | Single-company multi-step | "Company A gross-margin trend, last 4 quarters?" |
| Tier 3 (Stage 2) | Cross-company dependency/exposure | "If Apple cut orders 20%, which suppliers are most exposed?" |

## Evaluation Harness (Signature 2 — start Week 5–6)

Metrics:
- Numeric accuracy (exact / tolerance match)
- Citation precision / recall
- Faithfulness (LLM-judge: no fabrication)
- Refusal correctness (unanswerable questions must be refused)
- Latency & cost per question

**Eval set is frozen.** Run regression on every change.

The headline result (Stage 2): baseline naive-RAG vs graph-augmented agent on Tier-3 questions → quantified vertical-accuracy delta.

---

## Engineering Principles

1. **Walking Skeleton first.** By end of Week 2, one thin thread through every layer (ugly but alive).
2. **Breadth across the stack, depth in two signatures only:** agent orchestration and eval harness.
3. **Do not go deep on retrieval** — that's the crowded trap.
4. **XBRL bypass** — structured numbers avoid PDF extraction entirely.
5. **Eval-first** — harness drives iteration from Week 5–6 onward.

---

## Acceptance Criteria ("done")

1. A Tier-3 dependency question → correct, cited, number-verifiable answer with reasoning steps.
2. An unanswerable question → correct refusal, no fabrication.
3. Quantified three-tier eval results (numeric / citation / faithfulness / refusal + cost/latency) **and the baseline-vs-graph ablation delta**.
4. Live deployment + scheduled ingestion running.
